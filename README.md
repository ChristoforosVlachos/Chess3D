## Try it!

If you are using a 64-bit Windows computer, you can download a pre-built version of the app on the releases section.

## Build from source

If your computer uses a different operating system (please note that this program has only been tested on 64-bit Windows) or you insist on building the app yourself, you may do so using CMake and Visual Studio.
